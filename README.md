### Linux
* WM: i3 - how about trying Qtile - it shows window title in the bar (miss it from DWM)
* Terminal: st - I'm here all day, it must be fast
* Shell: zsh

### OSX
* ~WM: chunkwm + skhd
* Terminal: kitty

### TODO
- [x] Switch from on-my-zsh to antigen.
- [x] Disable Ctrl+S and Ctrl+Q.
- [ ] Find a non-distructive way to change prompt for zsh's vim plugin.
- [ ] Clean st from the features I don't use
- [x] Rethink unicode strategy for i3blocks labels.
- [ ] Switch from Vundle to Plug
- [ ] Decent color scheme for vimdiff
